The formula =NORM.S.INV((RANK(A2, $A$2:$A$16, 1) - 0.5)/COUNT(A:A)) is being used to generate z-values for a normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) in Excel. Here's how it works:

RANK(A2, $A$2:$A$16, 1) calculates the rank of the data value in cell A2 among the range $A$2:$A$16 in ascending order.

Subtracting 0.5 adjusts the rank to represent the midpoint of the rank interval, which improves the approximation for small datasets.

COUNT(A:A) gives the total number of data points, which normalizes the rank to a percentile.

The entire expression (RANK(...) - 0.5)/COUNT(...) converts the rank into a cumulative probability.

Finally, NORM.S.INV(...) computes the z-score (standard normal quantile) corresponding to that cumulative probability.

This results in a z-value that can be plotted against the original data points. The scatter plot created in the image compares the data against a standard normal distribution. If the data is normally distributed, the points will lie approximately on a straight line, which helps visually assess normality.

In general, the formula

=NORM.S.INV((RANK(x, data_range, 1) - 0.5) / COUNT(data_range))
is used to convert a sorted data point x into its corresponding z-score (standard normal quantile) for a normal probability plot.

Purpose:
It helps you check if a dataset is normally distributed by plotting:

x-values (original data) vs.

y-values (theoretical z-scores under a normal distribution)

If the points form a straight line, the data likely follows a normal distribution.
