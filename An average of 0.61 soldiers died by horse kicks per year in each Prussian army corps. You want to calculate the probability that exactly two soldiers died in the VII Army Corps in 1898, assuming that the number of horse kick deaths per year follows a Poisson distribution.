To solve the problem of finding the probability that exactly two soldiers died from horse kicks in the VII Army Corps in 1898, we used the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is ideal for modeling the number of times an event occurs within a fixed interval of time or space, especially when the events are rare and occur independently. In this case, the "event" is a soldier dying from a horse kick, and the time interval is one year.

We were given the mean number of deaths (Î») as 0.61, and we needed to find the probability of exactly k = 2 deaths in that year. Using Excel, we applied the POISSON.DIST function with the formula =POISSON.DIST(2, 0.61, FALSE), where 2 is the number of deaths, 0.61 is the mean, and FALSE indicates we want the exact probability (not cumulative). The output of this function gave us a probability of approximately 0.1011, meaning there is about a 10.11% chance that exactly two soldiers died in that corps in 1898 due to horse kicks. We visualized this using a bar chart that clearly shows the probability for two deaths, helping us interpret the result more intuitively.
