In this analysis, we explored the Binomial Distribution for a random variable X∼B(n=10,p=0.5), which models the number of successes in 10 independent Bernoulli trials, each with a success probability of 0.5. We calculated the probability mass function (PMF) values for all possible outcomes k=0 to 10 using the formula =BINOMDIST(k, n, p, FALSE) in Excel. Specifically, the Excel formula used in cell B2 was: =BINOMDIST(A2, $E$1, $E$2, FALSE) where A2 holds the value of k, E1 contains n=10, and E2 contains p=0.5. Dragging this formula down allowed us to compute P(X=k) for each value of k from 0 to 10. The resulting probabilities form a symmetric distribution centered around k=5, which is the expected value for this distribution. We then created a Scatter Chart with Straight Lines and Markers in Excel to graphically represent the distribution. The chart is titled “Binomial Probability Mass Function (n = 10, p = 0.5)”, with the x-axis labeled “Values of k” and the y-axis labeled “Probabilities for X = k”. This visualization effectively illustrates the discrete nature and bell-shaped curve of the binomial distribution for the chosen parameters.
