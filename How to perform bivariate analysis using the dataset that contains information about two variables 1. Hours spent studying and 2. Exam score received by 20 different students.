The screenshot presents a bivariate analysis examining the relationship between hours spent studying (independent variable, Column A) and exam scores (dependent variable, Column B). The data shows a clear positive linear trend, where increasing study hours correspond to higher exam scores.
Key Findings:
1.	Correlation Coefficient (0.992):
o	Nearly perfect positive correlation (r ≈ 0.992), indicating study time strongly predicts exam performance.
2.	Regression Equation (y = 5.294x + 43.85):
o	For every additional hour studied, exam scores increase by ~5.294 points.
o	The intercept (*43.85*) suggests the baseline score with zero study hours.
3.	R² Value (0.983):
o	98.3% of the variation in exam scores is explained by study hours, demonstrating an excellent model fit.
4.	Visual Representation:
o	The "Series1" and "Linear (Series1)" labels imply a scatter plot with a fitted trendline, visually confirming the linear relationship.
Conclusion:
This analysis confirms a strong, linear dependence between study time and exam performance, validated by high correlation, precise regression, and near-perfect R². It is a classic example of bivariate analysis using linear regression.

In the bivariate analysis shown in the chart (which plots Hours Spent Studying vs. Exam Score), the values of y and R² are derived from the linear regression trendline equation displayed on the graph.
From the image:
Equation of the trendline (y):
y=5.294x+43.85
This means for every 1 additional hour spent studying, the exam score is predicted to increase by approximately 5.294 points, starting from a base of 43.85.
R² (Coefficient of Determination): R^2 =0.983
This indicates that 98.3% of the variance in exam scores can be explained by the number of hours spent studying — which is extremely strong and suggests a very good linear fit.
These results confirm a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and exam performance.
