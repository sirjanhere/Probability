The Poisson distribution describes the probability of obtaining k successes during a given time interval.

If a random variable X follows a Poisson distribution, then the probability that X = k successes can be found by the following formula:

P(X=k) = λk * e– λ / k!

where:

λ: mean number of successes that occur during a specific interval
k: number of successes
e: a constant equal to approximately 2.71828
