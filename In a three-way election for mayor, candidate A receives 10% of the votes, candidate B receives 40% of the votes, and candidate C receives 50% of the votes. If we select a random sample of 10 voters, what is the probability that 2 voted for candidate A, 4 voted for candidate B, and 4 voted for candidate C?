We calculated the probability of a specific voting outcome where 2 voters chose candidate A, 4 chose B, and 4 chose C out of 10 voters. The multinomial probability formula was applied:
Probability = (n! / (x₁! x₂! x₃!)) × p₁ˣ¹ × p₂ˣ² × p₃ˣ³
Steps in the sheet:
1.	Inputs:
o	Total voters (n = 10), votes for A (x₁ = 2), B (x₂ = 4), C (x₃ = 4).
o	Probabilities: p₁ = 0.1 (A), p₂ = 0.4 (B), p₃ = 0.5 (C).
2.	Calculations:
o	p₁ˣ¹: =B6^B2 → 0.1² = 0.01
o	p₂ˣ²: =B7^B3 → 0.4⁴ = 0.0256
o	p₃ˣ³: =B8^B4 → 0.5⁴ = 0.0625
o	Multinomial coefficient: =MULTINOMIAL(B2,B3,B4) → 10!/(2!4!4!) = 3150
3.	Final Probability:
= 3150 × 0.01 × 0.0256 × 0.0625 = 0.0504 (5.04%).
